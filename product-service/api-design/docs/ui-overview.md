2. **Project Trees:** The project sidebar tree tabs provide different views into your project. Switch between a view of API related assets, docs, and all of the files/folders in your project.
3. **Primary Panel:** You can switch which mode is shown on the primary panel by clicking the mode selector in the top right. You can show the form editor, docs view, or code editor here. You can also click the expand button to go full screen with the panel.
